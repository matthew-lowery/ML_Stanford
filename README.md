Assignments from Andrew Ng's Stanford ML course

##ex1 contains code for completing a vectorized implementation of linear regression, with both gradient descent and the normal equation implemented 
to minimize the cost function and achieve ideal theta values

##ex2 contains code for completing a vectorized implementation of a regularized logistic regression classifier 

##ex3 contains code for completing a vectorized implementation of an One-vs-All logistic regression classifier
