Assignments from Andrew Ng's Stanford ML course

### ex1 
contains code for completing a vectorized implementation of linear regression, with both gradient descent and the normal equation implemented to minimize the cost function and achieve ideal theta values

### ex2 
contains code for completing a vectorized implementation of a logistic regression classifier, with a regularized cost function  

### ex3 
contains code for completing a vectorized implementation of an One-vs-All logistic regression classifier and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits

### ex4 
implement the backpropagation algorithm and regularization for neural networks, applying it to recognize hand-written digits

### ex5 
implement linear regression (w/ polynomial features added), using it to study models with different bias-variance properties
from learning curves & what not

### ex6 
using SVMs to build a spam email classifier
